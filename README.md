# Building a healthier feed: Private location trace intersection driven feed recommendations
A paper by Tobin South, Nick Lothian, and Alex 'Sandy' Pentland


## Structure
This repo has three main sections: 
* A python technical demo for matching on location data or images using private set intersection, and how this could be mapped to a feed.
* A React web demo to show how this could be used in a javascript context. This is being worked to integrate directly with Verdia datastores.
* The figures and reproducable results for the paper.
